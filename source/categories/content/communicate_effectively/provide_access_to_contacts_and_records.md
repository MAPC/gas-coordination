In order to provide smooth, two-way communication, utilities and municipalities should proactively share contact information for key staff and provide critical data.

__Utilities__

- Create online-accessible list of gas company key contacts.
    - This list should mention key contacts' areas of responsibility.
- Provide a mechanism so that municipalities can notify supervisors if they are not receiving a timely response from the designated key contact / staff member.
- Develop a list of municipal data that more than one department in the company needs, and ensure proper access to those records.
  - Provide a way to notify staff when data is updated.

__Municipalities__

- Use the utilities' key contacts list to communicate with the right person.
- Actively provide utilities with data when requested, and proactively notify key contacts when data is updated.
