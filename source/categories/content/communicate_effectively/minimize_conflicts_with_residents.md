Homeowners and businesses may request new gas services in areas with active paving moratoriums, but utilities and municipalities can help avert these conflicting requests.

__Municipalities__

- Maintain and share moratorium information proactively. Ideally, this information would be available online, and in spatial data formats.
- Prior to the construction season, notify homeowners and businesses on streets that are slated for paving of the impending moratorium.

__Utilities__

- Provide municipalities with flyers to announce paving and the impending moratorium. These flyers could increase new service sales for the gas company.
- Enact policy to prohibit direct mail, call or email campaigns for new customers on segments of road that are within the five-year moratorium.
  - Note: General radio, internet or television ads may still bring in new customer requests.
- Ensure the sales division has access to and is aware of municipal moratorium information.
