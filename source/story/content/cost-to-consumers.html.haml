     %p Municipalities pave roads curb-to-curb. Gas companies pave over their trenches. When gas mains are replaced before a municipality paves curb-to-curb, the gas company can avoid much of the cost of paving the trench. Some of that cost can be shared with the municipality, and some used to replace more pipe. Coordination also means the municipality avoids cuts and patches in the road that increase maintenance costs and reduce its useful life.
