  narrative: >
    Gas company representatives who interact with the municipal staff serve a
    critical role in conveying information back and forth between the two
    organizations. Having good relationships in place allows both parties to
    build trust, understand the needs and rules of the other party, and improve
    communication&ndash;all of which can make the planning and execution of paving
    and gas main work more efficient.
  goals:
    - Build trust and understanding between municipalities and utilities.
    - Clarify policies with residents desiring new gas service.
  action_steps:
    - Provide access to contacts and records
    - Minimize conflicts with residents

    Many of the improvements we can make to improve coordination and save costs
    during paving and gas line repair are short-term, meaning they can be done
    during or shortly before the construction season. Some, however, require
    a more significant investment.

    Our basic premise is this: we cannot succesfully repair 400% of the normal
    amount of gas line with the systems we use presently. In order to make our
    plan work and repair our aging infrastructure, we must structure our work
    in a way that significantly increases our capacity.
  goals:
    - Stabilize working relationships betweeen municipalities and utilities.
    - Improve work systems to meet the challenge.
    - Improve internal processes of municipalities and utilities.
  action_steps:
    - Assess capacity to reduce staff turnover
    - Improve staff transition process
    - Incorporate GIS
    - Resolve tense relationships
