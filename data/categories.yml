    Buying a home is exciting. It’s also one of the most important financial
    decisions you’ll make. Choosing a mortgage to pay for your new home is
    just as important. Don’t rush into it. Before you start shopping for a
    home and a mortgage, take time to prepare. You’ll be in a better position
    to make great choices if you first check your credit, assess your
    finances, set your home-price budget, and decide for yourself whether
    it’s the right time to buy.
